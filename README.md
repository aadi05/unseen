This is my python tkinter project which i made in my second year of IT Engineering.
Following are the things you need to do to run my program:
1) Extract unseen.rar file.
2) Use any IDE you want i used pycharm in making of this project.
3) Download following libraries: a)pillow  b)pywin32 and some additional libraries if you get a unknown module error (If you are using pycharm then you will need to install all these libraries into the settings/project interpreter as well).
4) You can download these libraries by opening windows command prompt into the python folder and type "pip install library_name"
5) After this change the location of the imported files like text files,images etc.
6) Everything's done. Now you can hit run button and get greeted with amazing GUI application.

I hope it works. If you have any questions then email me at: adityabhogate5@gmail.com
