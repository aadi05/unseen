Set in 1303 AD medieval India, Padmaavat is the story of honour, valour and obsession. Queen Padmavati is
known for her exceptional beauty along with a strong sense of justice and is the wife of Maharawal Ratan Singh
and pride of the Kingdom of Chittor, a prosperous kingdom in the north west of India.
The legend of her beauty reaches the reigning sultan of Hindustan-Allaudin Khilji. The sultan who is a tyrant,
is fixated with wanting anything that is of exceptional beauty for himself. He lays siege on the impregnable
fortress of Chittorgarh.
After a gruelling 6 months, he returns empty handed. He becomes obsessed and now wants to capture Chittor
and its Queen at any cost. He returns with a bigger army and raging fury. He attacks Chittor with brutal force and
a bloody and fearsome battle takes place between the righteous Maharawal Ratan Singh defending his kingdom
and the honour of his Queen and Sultan Allaudin Khilji. Khilji manages to breach the fortress but it goes in vain
as the Queen chooses to make the ultimate sacrifice to protect her dignity.
